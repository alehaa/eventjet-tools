Scripts to process data from Eventjet.


## About

Eventjet is an online platform for selling tickets for events and provides
infrastructure to checkin the guests. For sold tickets and the whole event, data
will be gathered and accessed via the admin panel. However, this data needs some
post-processing, before it may be used e.g. for Facebook advertising. The tools
in this repository will help to process the data.
