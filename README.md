Scripts to process data from Eventjet.


## About

Eventjet is an online platform for selling tickets for events and provides
infrastructure to checkin the guests. For ticket sales and the whole event, data
will be gathered and accessed via the admin panel. However, this data needs some
post-processing, before it may be used e.g. for Facebook advertising. The tools
in this repository will help to process the data.


## Using The Commands

#### `eventjet-fbtargeting`

The data gathered in ticket sales and the guestlist registration may be used for
Facebook advertising, but the CSV formats are not compatible out-of-the-box.
This command will process the data downloaded by Eventjet and generates a new
CSV file compatible with Facebook.

*__Note__: If a guest buys more than one ticket, the same personal data record
will be printed several times for each ticket. For large datasets you may filter
these by pipeing the output into the `uniq` command before saving:
`eventjet-fbtargeting < guests.csv | uniq > fb.csv`.*

*__Warning:__ Some countries require a consent form of the user receiving
advertisement in conjunction with his personal data (which is generated by this
command), so the list of guests will be filtered by the guest's acceptance of
the newsletter. Please check the law before disabling this filter!*
